*ABOUT*
 -----
This is a minimal implementation of most of the features of LISP 1.5.
The LISP interpreter supports both interactive and batch modes.

Note: atoms in this implementation are case-insensitive.

 -----
*USAGE*
 -----

*Interactive mode: Simply run './interpreter.py' to start an interactive
 ----------------  toplevel. LISP commands may be entered over multiple lines;
                   a command will not be evaluated until the parentheses
		   match.

                   Pressing "Control+c" abandons the current expression
		   and starts a new line. Calling (help) gives some minimal
		   help.

		   When finished, type (quit) or press "Control+d" to exit.


*Batch mode:       Run './interpreter.py <input file>'. All expressions in the
 ----------	   file will be read, evaluated, and printed in order to
                   standard output.
