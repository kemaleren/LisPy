ABOUT
-----

LisPy is a minimal implementation of most of the features of LISP 1.5,
as outlined in John McCarthy's [LISP 1.5 Programmer's Manual][manual].

LisPy supports both interactive and batch modes.


REQUIREMENTS
------------

* Python (tested with 2.6 and 2.7)


USAGE
-----

NB: atoms in this implementation are case-insensitive.

### Interactive mode:

In interactive mode, individual LISP commands may be entered
into the REPL (read-eval-print loop).

Simply run './interpreter.py' to start an interactive
toplevel. LISP commands may be entered over multiple lines;
a command will not be evaluated until the parentheses
match.

Pressing "Control+c" abandons the current expression
and starts a new line. Calling (help) gives some minimal
help.

When finished, type (quit) or press "Control+d" to exit.


### Batch mode

Run './interpreter.py <input file>'. All expressions in the
file will be read, evaluated, and printed in order to
standard output.
